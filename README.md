**Tidal Turbulence Probe GUI**

This repository contains the source code for a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed for a tidal turbulence probe
called BARNACLE. The project aims to improve the usability and reduce the fluid dynamics knowledge needed for
operating the BARNACLE probe.

**Background**

The United Kingdom possesses a significant portion of Europe's tidal energy resource and has the potential to supply
11% of the UK's current electricity demand. However, tidal energy generation is still limited due to high costs
compared to other renewable energy sources. One of the factors contributing to these high costs is the limited
understanding of the harsh operating environment of tidal turbines.

Tidal turbulence studies reveal considerable variations between sites, and existing numerical models and measurement
tools are both costly and inaccurate. The BARNACLE probe offers a cost-effective and accurate solution for measuring
tidal stream turbulence. However, its data processing capabilities are limited, and data processing was previously
done in MATLAB, which many users might not have access to.

This project was completed as part of a BEng Final Year Project.
